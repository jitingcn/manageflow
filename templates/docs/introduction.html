<p> Today, workflow management software is a must-have for keeping teams unified, 
    especially with the growing complexity and fast pace of our multi-taking, 
    distributed workforce. Taking advantage of the new capabilities offered by automation 
    and the availability of useful data for decision-making, you can do so much better 
    than a to-do list. Manageflow adds a layer of structure and visibility to your workflow, 
    helping you turn ideas into products, and concepts into processes. It helps you ensure 
    that the project is delivered properly and that the quality of the project is maintained. 
    These tools support you as you schedule tasks, collaborate with others, manage workloads, 
    create and share documentation, and evaluate progress.
